### Comments

1. No assumptions were made beyond what was already evident from the design specifications. My implementation closely followed the design specifications. I confirmed the success of my implementation by comparing my input and output files through unit testing and finding them to be identical. To verify the effectiveness of my defensive-programming methods, I conducted tests on specific parameters. Finally, I performed valgrind tests and found no bugs or memory leaks.
